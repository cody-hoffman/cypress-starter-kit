# Cypress Starter Kit :rocket:

[Cypress](cypress.io) is the swiss army knife of automated testing. A lot of this project is boilerplate code that we will need to get started on any cypress project. The easiest way to get started:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/cody-hoffman/cypress-starter-kit.git my-new-cypress-project
```

## [Why Cypress?](https://www.cypress.io/features)    :thinking:

It's one easy to learn framework that can do many things, most notably end-to-end testing and API contract testing. Cypress has a really simple API that is built on top of mocha. It's easy to learn for anyone with JS unit testing experience.

## [Plugins](https://docs.cypress.io/plugins/)    :electric_plug:

Cypress has a solid following and a good plugin ecosystem to take care of things like:

- [CircleCI Orb](https://github.com/cypress-io/circleci-orb)
- [React Component Unit Testing](https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-react-unit-test)
- [Retries](https://github.com/Bkucera/cypress-plugin-retries)
- [Slack Integration](https://github.com/bdimitrovski/cypress-healthcheck)
